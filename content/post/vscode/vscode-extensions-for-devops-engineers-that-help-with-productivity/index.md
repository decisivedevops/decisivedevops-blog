### Path Autocomplete

[Path Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete) extension can benefit you if you work on a project with many files. It gives you suggestions for paths as you type, which can save you a lot of time when you want to refer to a file in, let\'s say, a shell script. This extension adds autocomplete functionality for filenames and paths across all workspace folders.

The [Remove Empty Lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.remove-empty-lines) extension can help you with that. It removes all blank lines from the current document or the selection if there is one.

If you\'re working on a shell script, the [shell-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foxundermoon.shell-format) extension can help you format it correctly. It formats your code according to the POSIX standard and can even help fix some common shell script errors.

### Remote - SSH

The [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension is helpful if you need to connect to a remote server via SSH. It allows you to open a folder on a remote server and work with it as if it were a local folder. You can edit files directly on the server, and the changes will be synced back to your local machine.
