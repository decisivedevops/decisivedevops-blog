You will attempt to advance through levels in this game by completing various tasks. The next level's information is provided once the previous level has been completed.

You'll frequently find yourself in uncomfortable or confusing circumstances, not knowing what to do next. It's natural to feel this way- but don't give up! The goal of this game is for you to become proficient in the basics. And acquiring that knowledge includes reading a bunch of new materials.

Start at [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html) and work your way up! And if you are stuck at any level, you can refer to this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1H1sBF1VAKUsYdQd94dO9MgSaY2p1AJ4) for solutions and explanations.

But fret not; if you are unsure what to answer at any stage, you can quickly view solutions submitted by other users.

There are two other main challenges also. Each with its unique set of scenarios.
